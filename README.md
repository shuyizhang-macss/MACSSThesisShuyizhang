# MACSSThesis_shuyizhang: Effects of Price Reduction on Consumersâ€™ Purchasing Behavior: Mediating Effect of Tax, Review Rate and Customer Insight


## Abstract
This study investigates the impact of price reduction on consumers' purchasing in the context of Airbnb listings, with an emphasis on the mediating role of tax rates, review ratings, and customer attributes. The research utilizes web-scraped data from Airbnb and U.S. state tax records to test various hypotheses. and employs time series multiple regression, propensity score matching, panel data regression, and cluster analysis. Key research questions include: 1) How can Airbnb hosts balance the trade-off between lower prices and occupancy rates? 2) Is tthe phenomenon of a higher occupancy rate and weekly revenue due to price promotions be more evident for Airbnb listings with higher review ratings? 3) Is the effect of price promotion on occupancy rate vary across different regions due to differences in tax rates? 4) Which consumer groups are more likely to be influenced by discounts and price promotions, and why? Will more experienced and loyal consumer groups (those Airbnb guests with higher number of review and number of years on Airbnb) be less affected by review rating and price promotions?
